This repository provides the Jupyter Notebooks with the code of the algorithm described in the paper:

```
Stefano Giagu et al. "A Deep Neural Network based approach for Domain Adaptation in 3D Segmentation of Lungs affected by COVID19 lesions"
```

## Contents
- placeholder contains the code used to train and test the different settings analyzed in the article
- placeholder contain the code used to train and test the proposed method

The trained model of our algorithm is stored on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).

### How to use the Jupyter Notebooks:
In this section it is explained how to use the implemented code with a more in depth descrpition of its main parts.
